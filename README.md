# State of the database in XRD

 We, the AiMat group the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), are collecting a dataset of both labeled and unlabeled experimental X-ray diffraction data, which will be made publicly available once sufficient data has been collected.
 
 Once sufficient data is collected it will be published in the form of a standardized and cohesive dataset for anyone to use. This repository contains a draft of a paperm that we will publish along with the the dataset to survey it and discuss its uses.
 
 We could be happy to include anyone contributing data as a co-author. If you would like to be included as a co-author please notify the maintainer of this repository, through a mail to daniel.hollarek@student.kit.edu.
