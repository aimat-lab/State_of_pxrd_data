  abstract = {TensorFlow is an interface for expressing machine learning algorithms, and an implementation for executing such algorithms. A computation expressed using TensorFlow can be executed with little or no change on a wide variety of heterogeneous systems, ranging from mobile devices such as phones and tablets up to large-scale distributed systems of hundreds of machines and thousands of computational devices such as GPU cards. The system is flexible and can be used to express a wide variety of algorithms, including training and inference algorithms for deep neural network models, and it has been used for conducting research and for deploying machine learning systems into production across more than a dozen areas of computer science and other fields, including speech recognition, computer vision, robotics, information retrieval, natural language processing, geographic information extraction, and computational drug discovery. This paper describes the TensorFlow interface and an implementation of that interface that we have built at Google. The TensorFlow API and a reference implementation were released as an open-source package under the Apache 2.0 license in November, 2015 and are available at www.tensorflow.org.},

The Rietveld method usually represents the final step of the powder solution process, in particular when a new structure is going to be determined and published. EXPO is a software able to execute all the steps of the solution process in a mostly automatic way, by starting from the chemical formula and the experimental diffraction pattern, passing through computational methods for locating the structure model and optimizing it, and ending to the Rietveld refinement. In this contribution, we present the most recent solution strategies in EXPO, both in reciprocal and direct space, aiming at obtaining models suitable to be refined by the Rietveld method. Examples of Rietveld refinements are described, whose results are related to different solution procedures and types of compounds (organic and inorganic).},

  abstract = {Version 12 of XTALOPT, an evolutionary algorithm for crystal structure prediction, is now available for download from the CPC program library or the XTALOPT website, http://xtalopt.github.io. The new version includes: a method for calculating hardness using a machine learning algorithm within AFLOW-ML (Automatic FLOW for Materials Discovery \textemdash{} Machine Learning), the ability to predict hard materials, a generic optimizer (which allows the user to employ many optimizers that were previously not supported), and the ability to generate simulated XRD (X-ray diffraction) patterns. New version program summary: Program Title: XTALOPT Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/jt5pvnnm39.3 Licensing provisions: 3-Clause BSD [1] Programming language: C++ External routines/libraries: QT [2], QWT [3], AVOGADRO2 [4,5] (optional), LIBSSH [6], OPEN BABEL [7,8] (separate executable), OBJCRYST++ [9,10] (separate executable), AFLOW-ML [11,12] (through network), and an external program for optimizing the geometries of extended systems. Subprograms used: PUGIXML [13], SPGLIB [14], XTALCOMP [15], RANDSPG [16]. Nature of problem: Computationally predicting stable and/or hard crystal structures given only their stoichiometry. Solution method: Evolutionary algorithms (EAs), which use ideas from biological evolution, are optimization algorithms whose goal is to find the optimal solution for a problem that has many degrees of freedom. For a priori crystal structure prediction (CSP), EAs search to find the lattice parameters and atomic coordinates that, for example, minimize the energy/enthalpy or maximize the hardness. The XTALOPT EA for crystal structure prediction is published under the 3-Clause BSD License, which is an open source license that is officially recognized by the Open Source Initiative [17]. More information is available in the following publications: XTALOPT's original implementation [18], previous version announcements [19\textendash 22], manuscripts detailing the subprograms XTALOPT employs: XTALCOMP [23] and RANDSPG [24], and the XtalOpt website [25]. Reasons for new version: Since the release of XTALOPT version r11 in January 2018, the following changes have been made: \textbullet{} Added a hardness calculation via AFLOW-ML (Automatic FLOW for Materials Discovery \textemdash{} Machine Learning). \textbullet{} Added a hardness fitness function, which allows for the prediction of hard structures. \textbullet{} Added a generic optimizer, which allows the user to employ many previously unsupported optimizers for minimizing the geometry of an extended system. \textbullet{} Added the ability to generate a simulated XRD (X-ray Diffraction) pattern. \textbullet{} Added the ability to use different optimizers and queuing interfaces for each optimization step. \textbullet{} Implemented various bug fixes. Summary of revisions: The theoretical hardness of a crystal can now be automatically calculated during an XTALOPT run. The hardness is calculated through a linear relationship with the shear modulus (originally discovered by Teter [26]) as reported by Chen [27]. The shear modulus is obtained via AFLOW-ML [11,12], which employs a machine learning model trained with the AFLOW Automatic Elasticity Library (AEL) [28,29]. As a result, the EA can employ a new fitness function, which attempts to minimize the enthalpy and maximize the hardness of the predicted structures. This facilitates the search for crystals that are both stable and hard. Additionally, a new generic optimizer was added that allows the user to employ optimizers that were previously not supported (ADF BAND [30] and ADF DFTB [31] are examples that we have thoroughly tested). The only caveat is that the rules for the generic optimizer, which are provided in the online tutorial, must be followed. OPEN BABEL [7,8] is used to read the output of the generic optimizer. Because of the addition of an executable that uses OBJCRYST++ [9,10], a simulated XRD pattern of a crystal can now also be generated during a structure search. Finally, different optimizers and different queuing interfaces can now be used for each optimization step. \textcopyright{} 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Training state-of-the-art, deep neural networks is computationally expensive. One way to reduce the training time is to normalize the activities of the neurons. A recently introduced technique called batch normalization uses the distribution of the summed input to a neuron over a mini-batch of training cases to compute a mean and variance which are then used to normalize the summed input to that neuron on each training case. This significantly reduces the training time in feed-forward neural networks. However, the effect of batch normalization is dependent on the mini-batch size and it is not obvious how to apply it to recurrent neural networks. In this paper, we transpose batch normalization into layer normalization by computing the mean and variance used for normalization from all of the summed inputs to the neurons in a layer on a single training case. Like batch normalization, we also give each neuron its own adaptive bias and gain which are applied after the normalization but before the non-linearity. Unlike batch normalization, layer normalization performs exactly the same computation at training and test times. It is also straightforward to apply to recurrent neural networks by computing the normalization statistics separately at each time step. Layer normalization is very effective at stabilizing the hidden state dynamics in recurrent networks. Empirically, we show that layer normalization can substantially reduce the training time compared with previously published techniques.},

Few solutions that aim to identify crystalline materials from the analysis of powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data have been reported to date. A careful inspection of the powder XRD data, and the corresponding highlight of specific failures when it has been used for the determination of the crystallographic phases of zeolites among mixtures, has allowed the creation of the recently proposed strategy: adaptable time warping (ATW). Herein, the design process is thoroughly detailed in a step-by-step manner, which allows a deep understanding of the motivations, improvements, and the resulting remarkable properties of our methodology. Because the use of high-throughput (HT) techniques for the discovery or for increasing the breadth of the synthetic routes of new microporous crystalline structures makes the reliability of search\textendash match methods a critical factor to be assessed, a meticulous evaluation of the reliability and the robustness is provided and supported by both empirical comparisons and mathematical proof. The results offered by our methodology, which clearly outperforms the well-established solutions, open the way towards total automation of such a routine procedure, eliminating laborious and time-consuming controls, preliminary treatments, and settings. Consequently, the proposed solution is of great interest and appears to be very promising, not only because of the numerous potential applications of XRD in materials science, but also the possible expansion of the solution to several other characterization techniques.},

In this Letter we introduce a new kind of neural-network representation of DFT potential-energy surfaces, which provides the energy and forces as a function of all atomic positions in systems of arbitrary size and is several orders of magnitude faster than DFT. The high accuracy of the method is demonstrated for bulk silicon and compared with empirical potentials and DFT.

  abstract = {The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400 exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information. Christopher M. Bishop is Deputy Director of Microsoft Research Cambridge, and holds a Chair in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow of Darwin College Cambridge, a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His previous textbook "Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition" has been widely adopted. Coming soon: *For students, worked solutions to a subset of exercises available on a public web site (for exercises marked "www" in the text) *For instructors, worked solutions to remaining exercises from the Springer web site *Lecture slides to accompany each chapter *Data sets available for download},

  abstract = {Can we use machine learning to compress graph data? The absence of ordering in graphs poses a significant challenge to conventional compression algorithms, limiting their attainable gains as well as their ability to discover relevant patterns. On the other hand, most graph compression approaches rely on domain-dependent handcrafted representations and cannot adapt to different underlying graph distributions. This work aims to establish the necessary principles a lossless graph compression method should follow to approach the entropy storage lower bound. Instead of making rigid assumptions about the graph distribution, we formulate the compressor as a probabilistic model that can be learned from data and generalise to unseen instances. Our "Partition and Code" framework entails three steps: first, a partitioning algorithm decomposes the graph into subgraphs, then these are mapped to the elements of a small dictionary on which we learn a probability distribution, and finally, an entropy encoder translates the representation into bits. All the components (partitioning, dictionary and distribution) are parametric and can be trained with gradient descent. We theoretically compare the compression quality of several graph encodings and prove, under mild conditions, that PnC achieves compression gains that grow either linearly or quadratically with the number of vertices. Empirically, PnC yields significant compression improvements on diverse real-world networks.},

Alloys containing 16 and 20 components in equal proportions are multiphase, crystalline and brittle both as-cast and after melt spinning. A five component Fe20Cr20Mn20Ni20Co20 alloy forms a single fcc solid solution which solidifies dendritically. A wide range of other six to nine component late transition metal rich multicomponent alloys exhibit the same majority fcc primary dendritic phase, which can dissolve substantial amounts of other transition metals such as Nb, Ti and V. More electronegative elements such as Cu and Ge are less stable in the fcc dendrites and are rejected into the interdendritic regions. The total number of phases is always well below the maximum equilibrium number allowed by the Gibbs phase rule, and even further below the maximum number allowed under non-equilibrium solidification conditions. Glassy structures are not formed by casting or melt spinning of late transition metal rich multicomponent alloys, indicating that the confusion principle does not apply, and other factors are more important in promoting glass formation.},

  abstract = {The experimental purpose of X-ray diffraction is to analyze crystalline material structure at the atomic and molecular levels. Such experiments are known as X-ray crystallography. Traditionally, human experts do it with some domain knowledge. X-ray crystallography is useful in numerous domains, e.g., physics, chemistry, and biology. It is tough to own manual physics of diffraction patterns to see a crystal structure with a colossal data set. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a deep neural network that maps an input image into a high-dimensional space. CNN produces an affordable function for image classification. This paper uses an extension of the convolutional neural network to predict crystal structure from diffraction patterns. We propose a machine-enabled method to predict crystallographic size and space group from a limited number of XRD patterns for small films. We overcome the problem of scarce data within the development of building materials by combining the learning model of moderately monitored equipment, a physics information-enhancing strategy using data generated from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database, and test data. We compare our approach with a large variety of typical addition as modern machine learning-based classification techniques for crystal structure prediction. Results show that our proposed system outperforms all the baselines by a significant margin for the crystal structure prediction task. Results also show the impact of the number of layers in the all-convolutional neural network architecture for crystal structure prediction.},

  abstract = {The ability to detect and count certain substructures in graphs is important for solving many tasks on graph-structured data, especially in the contexts of computational chemistry and biology as well as social network analysis. Inspired by this, we propose to study the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) via their ability to count attributed graph substructures, extending recent works that examine their power in graph isomorphism testing and function approximation. We distinguish between two types of substructure counting: induced-subgraph-count and subgraph-count, and establish both positive and negative answers for popular GNN architectures. Specifically, we prove that Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), 2-Weisfeiler-Lehman (2-WL) and 2-Invariant Graph Networks (2-IGNs) cannot perform induced-subgraph-count of substructures consisting of 3 or more nodes, while they can perform subgraph-count of star-shaped substructures. As an intermediary step, we prove that 2-WL and 2-IGNs are equivalent in distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs, partly answering an open problem raised in Maron et al. (2019). We also prove positive results for k-WL and k-IGNs as well as negative results for k-WL with a finite number of iterations. We then conduct experiments that support the theoretical results for MPNNs and 2-IGNs. Moreover, motivated by substructure counting and inspired by Murphy et al. (2019), we propose the Local Relational Pooling model and demonstrate that it is not only effective for substructure counting but also able to achieve competitive performance on molecular prediction tasks.},

  abstract = {Lattice parameter determination from X-ray powder diffraction patterns, called indexing, invariably requires the extraction of peak positions which are then used by indexing algorithms that are peak position dependent. The success of these algorithms depends on the accuracy of the extracted peak positions. Peak positions that do not overlap significantly with nearby peaks can be readily determined with great accuracy. However, in heavily overlapped regions it is difficult to determine the number of peaks and even more difficult to determine the peak positions accurately. This paper describes a new indexing algorithm, Lp-Search, that is implemented in the computer program TOPAS Version 7 (Bruker AXS, Karlsruhe, Germany). Lp-Search does not require peak position extraction nor does it require knowledge of the number of peaks present. Lp-Search combines Monte Carlo searches of lattice parameter space with a Pawley refinement used at the end of each search. Critical to the success of the Monte Carlo search is a new figure of merit function which allows the parameter space to be searched efficiently. Lp-Search has proved to be effective for patterns with heavily overlapped peaks; monoclinic to cubic lattices are successfully indexed in a matter of seconds and triclinic lattices within a minute or two. Diffraction patterns spanning a limited range, such that 30\textendash 40 peaks of the highest d spacing peaks are omitted, can be successfully indexed; this demonstrates the robust nature of Lp-Search.},

We describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function, which significantly simplifies setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. We give several efficient algorithms for empirical risk minimization problems with common and important regularization functions and domain constraints. We experimentally study our theoretical analysis and show that adaptive subgradient methods outperform state-of-the-art, yet non-adaptive, subgradient algorithms.},

  abstract = {Machine learning has been widely exploited in developing new materials. However, challenges still exist: small dataset is common for most tasks; new datasets, special descriptors and specific models need to be built from scratch when facing a new task; knowledge cannot be readily transferred between independent models. In this paper we propose a general and transferable deep learning (GTDL) framework for predicting phase formation in materials. The proposed GTDL framework maps raw data to pseudo-images with some special 2-D structure, e.g., periodic table, automatically extracts features and gains knowledge through convolutional neural network, and then transfers knowledge by sharing features extractors between models. Application of the GTDL framework in case studies on glass-forming ability and high-entropy alloys show that the GTDL framework for glass-forming ability outperformed previous models and can correctly predicted the newly reported amorphous alloy systems; for high-entropy alloys the GTDL framework can discriminate five types phases (BCC, FCC, HCP, amorphous, mixture) with accuracy and recall above 94\% in fivefold cross-validation. In addition, periodic table knowledge embedded in data representations and knowledge shared between models is beneficial for tasks with small dataset. This method can be easily applied to new materials development with small dataset by reusing well-trained models for related materials. \textcopyright{} 2021, The Author(s).},

The program, PowderBot, is developed based on Fullprof engine, which proves the effectiveness of AI in Rietveld refinement. In this program, the decision making in refinement process is modelled as a Markov decision process (MDP), and solved by a reinforcement learning algorithm. PowderBot is designed to be a self-learning system capable of conducting structure refinement without human intervention. The program has already been successfully applied to Rietveld refinements. We hope this paper will encourage more Rietveld programs become more intelligent by the help of AI algorithm.},

  abstract = {Bayesian optimization is an approach to optimizing objective functions that take a long time (minutes or hours) to evaluate. It is best-suited for optimization over continuous domains of less than 20 dimensions, and tolerates stochastic noise in function evaluations. It builds a surrogate for the objective and quantifies the uncertainty in that surrogate using a Bayesian machine learning technique, Gaussian process regression, and then uses an acquisition function defined from this surrogate to decide where to sample. In this tutorial, we describe how Bayesian optimization works, including Gaussian process regression and three common acquisition functions: expected improvement, entropy search, and knowledge gradient. We then discuss more advanced techniques, including running multiple function evaluations in parallel, multi-fidelity and multi-information source optimization, expensive-to-evaluate constraints, random environmental conditions, multi-task Bayesian optimization, and the inclusion of derivative information. We conclude with a discussion of Bayesian optimization software and future research directions in the field. Within our tutorial material we provide a generalization of expected improvement to noisy evaluations, beyond the noise-free setting where it is more commonly applied. This generalization is justified by a formal decision-theoretic argument, standing in contrast to previous ad hoc modifications.},

  abstract = {We present PyXtal, a new package based on the Python programming language, used to generate structures with specific symmetry and chemical compositions for both atomic and molecular systems. This software provides support for various systems described by point, rod, layer, and space group symmetries. With only the inputs of chemical composition and symmetry group information, PyXtal can automatically find a suitable combination of Wyckoff positions with a step-wise merging scheme. Further, when the molecular geometry is given, PyXtal can generate different dimensional organic crystals with molecules occupying both general and special Wyckoff positions. Optionally, PyXtal also accepts user-defined parameters (e.g., cell parameters, minimum distances and Wyckoff positions). In general, PyXtal serves three purposes: (1) to generate custom structures, (2) to modulate the structure by symmetry relations, (3) to interface the existing structure prediction codes that require the generation of random symmetric structures. In addition, we provide several utilities that facilitate the analysis of structures, including symmetry analysis, geometry optimization, and simulations of powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). Full documentation of PyXtal is available at https://pyxtal.readthedocs.io. Program summary Program Title: PyXtal CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/wfyxyhjzwx.1 Licensing provisions: MIT [1] Programming language: Python 3 Nature of problem: Knowledge of structure at the atomic level is the key to understanding materials' properties. Typically, the structure of a material can be determined either from experiment (such as X-ray diffraction, spectroscopy, microscopy) or from theory (e.g., enhanced sampling, structure prediction). In many cases, the structure needs to be solved iteratively by generating a number of trial structure models satisfying some constraints (e.g., chemical composition, symmetry, and unit cell parameters). Therefore, it is desirable to have a computational code that is able to generate such trial structures in an automated manner. Solution method: The PyXtal package is able to generate many possible random structures for both atomic and molecular systems with all possible symmetries. To generate the trial structure, the algorithm can either start with picking the symmetry sites randomly from high to low multiplicities, or use sites that are predefined by the user. For molecules, the algorithm can automatically detect the molecules' symmetry and place them into special Wyckoff positions while satisfying their compatible site symmetry. With the support of symmetry operations for point, rod, layer and space groups, PyXtal is suitable for the computational modeling of systems from zero, one, two, and three dimensional bulk crystals.

The multi-dimensional compositional space that can be tackled with this approach is practically limitless, and only tiny regions have been investigated so far. Nevertheless, a few high-entropy alloys have already been shown to possess exceptional properties, exceeding those of conventional alloys, and other outstanding high-entropy alloys are likely to be discovered in the future. Here, we review recent progress in understanding the salient features of high-entropy alloys. Model alloys whose behaviour has been carefully investigated are highlighted and their fundamental properties and underlying elementary mechanisms discussed. We also address the vast compositional space that remains to be explored and outline fruitful ways to identify regions within this space where high-entropy alloys with potentially interesting properties may be lurking.},

Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms. A website offers supplementary material for both readers and instructors.},

Nevertheless, substantial progress has been made in recent years in the scope and potential of techniques in this field. This article aims to highlight the types of structural problems for which structure determination may now be tackled directly from powder diffraction data, and contemporary applications across several chemical disciplines are presented.

With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression and path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, projection pursuit and gradient boosting.},

On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8\texttimes{} deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset.

  abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a stateof-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.82\% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

  abstract = {Machine learning techniques have proven invaluable to manage the ever growing volume of materials research data produced as developments continue in high-throughput materials simulation, fabrication, and characterization. In particular, machine learning techniques have been demonstrated for their utility in rapidly and automatically identifying potential composition\textendash phase maps from structural data characterization of composition spread libraries, enabling rapid materials fabrication-structure-property analysis and functional materials discovery. A key issue in development of an automated phase-diagram determination method is the choice of dissimilarity measure, or kernel function. The desired measure reduces the impact of confounding structural data issues on analysis performance. The issues include peak height changes and peak shifting due to lattice constant change as a function of composition. In this work, we investigate the choice of dissimilarity measure in X-ray diffraction-based structure analysis and the choice of measure's performance impact on automatic composition-phase map determination. Nine dissimilarity measures are investigated for their impact in analyzing X-ray diffraction patterns for a Fe\textendash Co\textendash Ni ternary alloy composition spread. The cosine, Pearson correlation coefficient, and Jensen\textendash Shannon divergence measures are shown to provide the best performance in the presence of peak height change and peak shifting (due to lattice constant change) when the magnitude of peak shifting is unknown. With prior knowledge of the maximum peak shifting, dynamic time warping in a normalized constrained mode provides the best performance. This work also serves to demonstrate a strategy for rapid analysis of a large number of X-ray diffraction patterns in general beyond data from combinatorial libraries.},

  abstract = {Properties of solid-state materials depend on their crystal structures. In solid solution high entropy alloy (HEA), its mechanical properties such as strength and ductility depend on its phase. Therefore, the crystal structure prediction should be preceded to find new functional materials. Recently, the machine learning-based approach has been successfully applied to the prediction of structural phases. However, since about 80\% of the data set is used as a training set in machine learning, it is well known that it requires vast cost for preparing a dataset of multi-element alloy as training. In this work, we develop an efficient approach to predicting the multi-element alloys' structural phases without preparing a large scale of the training dataset. We demonstrate that our method trained from binary alloy dataset can be applied to the multi-element alloys' crystal structure prediction by designing a transformation module from raw features to expandable form. Surprisingly, without involving the multi-element alloys in the training process, we obtain an accuracy, 80.56\% for the phase of the multi-element alloy and 84.20\% accuracy for the phase of HEA. It is comparable with the previous machine learning results. Besides, our approach saves at least three orders of magnitude computational cost for HEA by employing expandable features. We suggest that this accelerated approach can be applied to predicting various structural properties of multi-elements alloys that do not exist in the current structural database. \textcopyright{} 2021, The Author(s).},

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

The reported semi-supervised generative deep-learning model can train on both labeled data, i.e. diffraction patterns with the associated crystal structure, and unlabeled data, i.e. diffraction patterns that lack this information. This approach allows the models to take advantage of the troves of unlabeled data that current supervised learning approaches cannot, which should result in models that can more accurately generalize to real data. In this work, powder diffraction patterns are classified into all 14 Bravais lattices and 144 space groups (the number is limited due to sparse coverage in crystal structure databases), which covers more crystal classes than other studies. The reported models also outperform current deep-learning approaches for both space group and Bravais lattice classification using fewer training data.},

The NIST interest in the FPA method is specific to its ability to account for the optical aberrations of the powder diffraction experiment allowing for an accurate assessment of lattice parameter values. Lattice parameters are one of the primary certified measurands of NIST Standard Reference Materials (SRMs) for powder diffraction. Lattice parameter values obtained from analysis of data from SRMs 640e and 660c using both the NIST FPA Python code and the proprietary, commercial code Topas, that constitutes the only other actively supported, complete implementation of FPA models within a least-squares data analysis environment, agreed to within 2 fm. This level of agreement demonstrates that both the NIST code and Topas constitute an accurate implementation of published FPA models.},

  abstract = {X-Cell is a novel indexing algorithm that makes explicit use of systematic absences to search for possible indexing solutions from cells with low numbers of calculated reflections to cells with high numbers of reflections. Space groups with the same pattern of systematic absences are grouped together in powder extinction classes, and for a given peak number range an independent search is carried out in each powder extinction class. The method has the advantage that the correct cell is likely to be found before the rapid increase of possible solutions slows down the search significantly. A successive dichotomy approach is used to establish a complete list of all possible indexing solutions. The dichotomy procedure is combined with a search for the zero-point shift of the diffraction pattern, and impurity peaks can be dealt with by allowing for a user-defined portion of unindexed reflections. To rank indexing solutions with varying numbers of unindexed reflections, a new figure of merit is introduced that takes into account the highest level of agreement typically obtained for completely incorrect unit cells. The indexing of long and flat unit cells is facilitated by the possibility to search for rows or zones in reciprocal space first and then to use the lattice parameters of the dominant row or zone in the unit-cell search. The main advantages of X-Cell are robustness and completeness, as demonstrated by a validation study on a variety of compounds. The dominant phase of phase mixtures can be indexed in the presence of up to 50\% of impurity peaks if high-quality synchrotron data are available.},

A key enabler in high-throughput computational materials science efforts is a robust set of software tools to perform initial setup for the calculations (e.g., generation of structures and necessary input files) and post-calculation analysis to derive useful material properties from raw calculated data. The pymatgen library aims to meet these needs by (1) defining core Python objects for materials data representation, (2) providing a well-tested set of structure and thermodynamic analyses relevant to many applications, and (3) establishing an open platform for researchers to collaboratively develop sophisticated analyses of materials data obtained both from first principles calculations and experiments. The pymatgen library also provides convenient tools to obtain useful materials data via the Materials Project's REpresentational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API). As an example, using pymatgen's interface to the Materials Project's RESTful API and phasediagram package, we demonstrate how the phase and electrochemical stability of a recently synthesized material, Li4SnS4, can be analyzed using a minimum of computing resources. We find that Li4SnS4 is a stable phase in the Li\textendash Sn\textendash S phase diagram (consistent with the fact that it can be synthesized), but the narrow range of lithium chemical potentials for which it is predicted to be stable would suggest that it is not intrinsically stable against typical electrodes used in lithium-ion batteries.},

Additionally, we considered two practical issues: eliminating equipment errors and the time cost of the quality parameter evaluation. To overcome these issues, we adaptively conducted BO with different constraints for different situations. As a result of these optimizations, the crystal growth rate was increased to be approximately twice as high as that under standard conditions, while satisfying the five quality parameter conditions.},

We propose a machine learning-enabled approach to predict crystallographic dimensionality and space group from a limited number of thin-film XRD patterns. We overcome the scarce data problem intrinsic to novel materials development by coupling a supervised machine learning approach with a model-agnostic, physics-informed data augmentation strategy using simulated data from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) and experimental data. As a test case, 115 thin-film metal-halides spanning three dimensionalities and seven space groups are synthesized and classified. After testing various algorithms, we develop and implement an all convolutional neural network, with cross-validated accuracies for dimensionality and space group classification of 93 and 89\%, respectively. We propose average class activation maps, computed from a global average pooling layer, to allow high model interpretability by human experimentalists, elucidating the root causes of misclassification. Finally, we systematically evaluate the maximum XRD pattern step size (data acquisition rate) before loss of predictive accuracy occurs, and determine it to be 0.16\textdegree{} 2\texttheta, which enables an XRD pattern to be obtained and classified in 5.5\,min or less.},

This approach stabilises the analysis quality by eliminating human-origin variance and bias, and can be applied to various analysis methods in other areas which also suffer from similar tiresome and unsystematic manual tuning of extrinsic parameters and human-origin variance and bias.},

It has been used for the classification of powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns in terms of crystal system, extinction group and space group. About 150\hspace{0.25em}000 powder XRD patterns were collected and used as input for the CNN with no handcrafted engineering involved, and thereby an appropriate CNN architecture was obtained that allowed determination of the crystal system, extinction group and space group. In sharp contrast with the traditional use of powder XRD pattern analysis, the CNN never treats powder XRD patterns as a deconvoluted and discrete peak position or as intensity data, but instead the XRD patterns are regarded as nothing but a pattern similar to a picture. The CNN interprets features that humans cannot recognize in a powder XRD pattern. As a result, accuracy levels of 81.14, 83.83 and 94.99\% were achieved for the space-group, extinction-group and crystal-system classifications, respectively. The well trained CNN was then used for symmetry identification of unknown novel inorganic compounds.},

HELAO interfaces laboratory hardware and software distributed across several computers and operating systems for executing experiments, data analysis, provenance tracking, and autonomous planning. Parallelization is an effective approach for accelerating knowledge generation provided that multiple instruments can be effectively coordinated, which the authors demonstrate with parallel electrochemistry experiments orchestrated by HELAO. Efficient implementation of autonomous research strategies requires device sharing, asynchronous multithreading, and full integration of data management in experimental orchestration, which to the best of the authors' knowledge, is demonstrated for the first time herein.},

  abstract = {This contribution summarises the theoretical basics for the theory of x-ray matter interaction and is based on a quantised description of the electromagnetic field. In view of a formally transparent presentation, we adopt the approach of second quantisation for the electronic degrees of freedom. We start out from the minimal coupling Hamiltonian that in principle contains all levels of electron correlation and treat the x-ray matter interaction in lowest order perturbation theory. We give the explicit derivation of the photoionisation (x-ray absorption) cross section and the doubly differential cross sections for elastic and inelastic Thomson scattering, as well as resonant inelastic x-ray scattering. A connection to relevant experimental techniques is attempted. At some instances, the electronic Hamiltonian is approximated by a mean-field Hamiltonian, in order to facilitate the interpretation of the results and connect experimental observables with the underlying fundamental quantities of the quantum system under study.},

  abstract = {There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU. The full implementation (based on Caffe) and the trained networks are available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net.},

Using input data in the form of multiperspective atomic fingerprints, which describe coordination topology around unique crystallographic sites, we show that the neural-network model can be trained to effectively distinguish chemical elements based on the topology of their crystallographic environment. The model also identifies structurally similar atomic sites in the entire data set of {$\sim$}50000 crystal structures, essentially uncovering trends that reflect the periodic table of elements. The trained model was used to analyze templates derived from the known crystal structures in order to predict the likelihood of forming new compounds that could be generated by placing elements into these structural templates in a combinatorial fashion. Statistical analysis of predictive performance of the neural-network model, which was applied to a test set of structures never seen by the model during training, indicates its ability to predict known elemental compositions with a high likelihood of success. In {$\sim$}30\% of cases, the known compositions were found among the top 10 most likely candidates proposed by the model. These results suggest that the approach developed in this work can be used to effectively guide the synthetic efforts in the discovery of new materials, especially in the case of systems composed of three or more chemical elements.},

  abstract = {Batch Normalization (BatchNorm) is a widely adopted technique that enables faster and more stable training of deep neural networks (DNNs). Despite its pervasiveness, the exact reasons for BatchNorm's effectiveness are still poorly understood. The popular belief is that this effectiveness stems from controlling the change of the layers' input distributions during training to reduce the so-called "internal covariate shift". In this work, we demonstrate that such distributional stability of layer inputs has little to do with the success of BatchNorm. Instead, we uncover a more fundamental impact of BatchNorm on the training process: it makes the optimization landscape significantly smoother. This smoothness induces a more predictive and stable behavior of the gradients, allowing for faster training.},

  abstract = {High entropy oxides (HEOs) are a rapidly emerging class of chemically complex functional materials. The original paradigm of HEOs assumes cationic occupations with the highest possible configurational entropy allowed by the composition and crystallographic structure. However, the fundamental question remains on the actual degree of configurational disorder and its subsequent stabilizing role in HEOs. Considering the experimental limitations due to the inherent chemical complexity of HEOs, here we utilize a robust and cross-referenced characterization approach using soft X-ray magnetic circular dichroism, hard X-ray absorption spectroscopy, M\textbackslash "ossbauer spectroscopy, neutron powder diffraction and SQUID magnetometry to study the competition between enthalpy and configurational entropy on a lattice level in a model spinel HEO (S-HEO), (Co\$\_\{0.2\}\$Cr\$\_\{0.2\}\$Fe\$\_\{0.2\}\$Mn\$\_\{0.2\}\$Ni\$\_\{0.2\}\$)\$\_3\$O\$\_4\$. In contrast to the previous studies, the derived complete structural and spin-electronic model, (Co\$\_\{0.6\}\$Fe\$\_\{0.4\}\$)(Cr\$\_\{0.3\}\$Fe\$\_\{0.1\}\$Mn\$\_\{0.3\}\$Ni\$\_\{0.3\}\$)\$\_2\$O\$\_4\$, highlights a significant deviation from the hitherto assumed paradigm of entropy-driven non-preferential distribution of cations in HEOs. An immediate correlation of this result can be drawn with bulk as well as the local element specific magnetic properties, which are intrinsically dictated by cationic occupations in spinels. The real local lattice picture presented here provides an alternate viewpoint on ionic arrangement in HEOs, which is of fundamental interest for predicting and designing their structure-dependent functionalities.},

These compounds comprise the incorporation of multiple metal cations into single-phase crystal structures and interactions among the various metal cations leading to interesting novel and unexpected properties. Here, we report on the reversible lithium storage properties of the high entropy oxides, the underlying mechanisms governing these properties, and the influence of entropy stabilization on the electrochemical behavior. It is found that the stabilization effect of entropy brings significant benefits for the storage capacity retention of high entropy oxides and greatly improves the cycling stability. Additionally, it is observed that the electrochemical behavior of the high entropy oxides depends on each of the metal cations present, thus providing the opportunity to tailor the electrochemical properties by simply changing the elemental composition.},

A current trend in signal processing is to reformulate traditional processing pipelines as (deep) neural networks that can be trained end-to-end. A trainable algorithm for baseline removal and peak localization can serve as an important module in such a processing pipeline. In practical applications, one of the most successful approaches to joint baseline suppression and peak localization is based on the continuous wavelet transform: We re-formulate this as a convolutional neural network (CNN) followed by a non-linear readout layer. On a synthetic benchmark we demonstrate that with sufficient training data, the CNN approach consistently outperforms the optimized continuous wavelet method by means of adapting to the spectral peak shape, noise level, and characteristics of the baseline. The CNN approach to peak localization shows great promise, as it can more efficiently leverage data to outperform the current state of the art, and can readily be extended and incorporated as a module in a larger neural network architecture.},

  abstract = {Due to their versatile properties, x rays are a unique tool to investigate the structure and dynamics of matter. X-ray scattering is the fundamental principle of many imaging techniques. Examples are x-ray crystallography, which recently celebrated one hundred years and is currently the leading method in structure determination of proteins, as well as X-ray phase contrast imaging (PCI), which is an imaging technique with countless applications in biology, medicine, etc. The technological development of X-ray free electron lasers (XFEL) has brought x-ray imaging at the edge of a new scientific revolution. XFELs offer ultrashort x-ray pulses with unprecedented high x-ray fluence and excellent spatial coherence properties. These properties make them an outstanding radiation source for x-ray scattering experiments, providing ultrafast temporal resolution as well as atomic spatial resolution. However, the radiation-matter interaction in XFEL experiments also advances into a novel regime. This demands a sound theoretical fundament to describe and explore the new experimental possibilities. This dissertation is dedicated to the theoretical study of non resonant x-ray scattering. As the first topic, I consider the near-field imaging by propagation based x-ray phase contrast imaging (PCI). I devise a novel theory of PCI, in which radiation and matter are quantized. Remarkably, the crucial interference term automatically excludes contributions from inelastic scattering. This explains the success of the classical description thus far. The second topic of the thesis is the x-ray imaging of coherent electronic motion, where quantum effects become particularly apparent. The electron density of coherent electronic wave packets \textendash important in charge transfer and bond breaking \textendash{} varies in time, typically on femto- or attosecond time scales. In the near future, XFELs are envisaged to provide attosecond x-ray pulses, opening the possibility for time-resolved ultrafast x-ray scattering experiments. In the quantum theory it has however been revealed that x-ray scattering patterns of electronic motion are related to complex spatio-temporal correlations, instead of the instantaneous electron density. I scrutinize the time-resolved scattering pattern from coherent electronic wave packets. I show that time-resolved PCI recovers the instantaneous electron density of electronic motion. For the far-field diffraction scattering pattern, I analyze the influence of photon energy resolution of the detector. Moreover, I demonstrate that x-ray scattering from a crystal of identical wave packets also recovers the instantaneous electron density. I point out that a generalized electron density propagator of he wave packet can be reconstructed from a scattering experiment. Finally, I propose time-resolved Compton scattering of electronic wave packets. I show that x-ray scattering with large energy transfer can be used to recover the instantaneous momentum space density of the target. The third topic of this dissertation is Compton scattering in single molecule coherent diffractive imaging (CDI). The structure determination of single macromolecules via CDI is one of the key applications of XFELs. The structure of the molecule can be reconstructed from the elastic diffraction pattern. Inelastic x-ray scattering generates a background signal, which I determine for typical high-intensity imaging conditions. I find that at high x-ray fluence the background signal becomes dominating, posing a problem for high resolution imaging. The strong ionization by the x-ray pulse may ionize several electrons per atom. Scattering from these free electrons makes amaj or contribution to the background signal. I present and discuss detailed numerical studies for different x-ray fluence and photon energy. Slowik, Jan Malte},

AgileFD models alloying-based peak shifting through a novel expansion of convolutional nonnegative matrix factorization, which not only improves the identification of constituent phases but also maps their concentration and lattice parameter as a function of composition. By incorporating Gibbs' phase rule into the algorithm, physically meaningful phase maps are obtained with unsupervised operation, and more refined solutions are attained by injecting expert knowledge of the system. The algorithm is demonstrated through investigation of the V\textendash Mn\textendash Nb oxide system where decomposition of eight oxide phases, including two with substantial alloying, provides the first phase map for this pseudoternary system. This phase map enables interpretation of high-throughput band gap data, leading to the discovery of new solar light absorbers and the alloying-based tuning of the direct-allowed band gap energy of MnV2O6. The open-source family of AgileFD algorithms can be implemented into a broad range of high throughput workflows to accelerate materials discovery.},

At the core of this algorithm lies an ensemble convolutional neural network trained on simulated diffraction spectra, which are systematically augmented with physics-informed perturbations to account for artifacts that can arise during experimental sample preparation and synthesis. Larger perturbations associated with off-stoichiometry are also captured by supplementing the training set with hypothetical solid solutions. Spectra containing mixtures of materials are analyzed with a newly developed branching algorithm that utilizes the probabilistic nature of the neural network to explore suspected mixtures and identify the set of phases that maximize confidence in the prediction. Our model is benchmarked on simulated and experimentally measured diffraction spectra, showing exceptional performance with accuracies exceeding those given by previously reported methods based on profile matching and deep learning. We envision that the algorithm presented here may be integrated in experimental workflows to facilitate the high-throughput and autonomous discovery of inorganic materials.},

Multi-anionic and -cationic compounds are prepared by facile mechanochemistry using a recently designed multi-cationic transition-metal-based high entropy oxide as the precursor and LiF or NaCl as the reactant, leading to formation of lithiated or sodiated materials. Notably, the Li-containing entropy-stabilized oxyfluoride described herein (Lix(Co0.2Cu0.2Mg0.2Ni0.2Zn0.2)OFx) exhibits a working potential of 3.4 V vs. Li+/Li, enabling its use as a cathode active material. Unlike conventional (non-entropy-stabilized) oxyfluorides, this new material shows enhanced Li storage properties due to entropy stabilization, which, in general, facilitates tailoring the cycling performance by varying the constituent elements in yet unprecedented ways. In addition, we demonstrate that the concept of entropy stabilization is also applicable to Na-containing oxychlorides with a rock-salt structure, thus paving the way toward development of (next-generation) post-Li battery technologies.},

Herein, we report a convolutional neural network (CNN) that was trained based on theoretical data and very limited experimental data for fast identification of experimental X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of metal\textendash organic frameworks (MOFs). To augment the data for training the model, noise was extracted from experimental data and shuffled; then it was merged with the main peaks that were extracted from theoretical spectra to synthesize new spectra. For the first time, one-to-one material identification was achieved. Theoretical MOFs patterns (1012) were augmented to a whole data set of 72\,864 samples. It was then randomly shuffled and split into training (58\,292 samples) and validation (14\,572 samples) data sets at a ratio of 4:1. For the task of discriminating, the optimized model showed the highest identification accuracy of 96.7\% for the top 5 ranking on a test data set of 30 hold-out samples. Neighborhood component analysis (NCA) on the experimental XRD samples shows that the samples from the same material are clustered in groups in the NCA map. Analysis on the class activation maps of the last CNN layer further discloses the mechanism by which the CNN model successfully identifies individual MOFs from the XRD patterns. This CNN model trained by the data augmentation technique would not only open numerous potential applications for identifying XRD patterns for different materials, but also pave avenues to autonomously analyze data by other characterization tools such as FTIR, Raman, and NMR spectroscopies.},

In this paper, we explore using DFT data from high-throughput calculations to create faster, surrogate models with machine learning (ML) that can be used to guide new searches. Our method works by using decision tree models to map DFT-calculated formation enthalpies to a set of attributes consisting of two distinct types: (i) composition-dependent attributes of elemental properties (as have been used in previous ML models of DFT formation energies), combined with (ii) attributes derived from the Voronoi tessellation of the compound's crystal structure. The ML models created using this method have half the cross-validation error and similar training and evaluation speeds to models created with the Coulomb matrix and partial radial distribution function methods. For a dataset of 435 000 formation energies taken from the Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD), our model achieves a mean absolute error of 80 meV/atom in cross validation, which is lower than the approximate error between DFT-computed and experimentally measured formation enthalpies and below 15\% of the mean absolute deviation of the training set. We also demonstrate that our method can accurately estimate the formation energy of materials outside of the training set and be used to identify materials with especially large formation enthalpies. We propose that our models can be used to accelerate the discovery of new materials by identifying the most promising materials to study with DFT at little additional computational cost.},

Among multiple advantages of transformers, the ability to capture long-range dependencies and interactions is especially attractive for time series modeling, leading to exciting progress in various time series applications. In this paper, we systematically review transformer schemes for time series modeling by highlighting their strengths as well as limitations through a new taxonomy to summarize existing time series transformers in two perspectives. From the perspective of network modifications, we summarize the adaptations of module level and architecture level of the time series transformers. From the perspective of applications, we categorize time series transformers based on common tasks including forecasting, anomaly detection, and classification. Empirically, we perform robust analysis, model size analysis, and seasonal-trend decomposition analysis to study how Transformers perform in time series. Finally, we discuss and suggest future directions to provide useful research guidance. A corresponding resource list that will be continuously updated can be found in the GitHub repository. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work to comprehensively and systematically summarize the recent advances of Transformers for modeling time series data.

Based on an extensive dataset (1807 entries) built in this work, we applied multiple machine learning algorithms to train the dataset. After the blind test, we found that the Gradient boosting (GB) model can distinguish the single-phase-solid solution and non-single-phase-solid solution alloys with a test accuracy of 96.41\%. Given the GB model, we predicted over 100 equiatomic oxidation-resistance RHEAs from the composition space of eight metallic elements. After that, we synthesized ten of these predicted single-phase RHEAs by mechanical alloying. The XRD patterns show that all of them are single-phase BCC solid solution. The experimental results agree well with the prediction results, indicating the excellent performance of the machine learning model in single-phase RHEAs prediction. With the aid of the machine learning method, single-phase oxidation-resistant RHEAs were successfully designed. Our work presents a novel strategy with outstanding performance and evident effectiveness on the accelerated discovery of novel metallic materials used for extreme environments. \textcopyright{} 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Structural information of materials such as the crystal systems and space groups are highly useful for analyzing their physical properties. However, the enormous composition space of materials makes experimental X-ray diffraction (XRD) or first-principle-based structure determination methods infeasible for large-scale material screening in the composition space. Herein, we propose and evaluate machine-learning algorithms for determining the structure type of materials, given only their compositions. We couple random forest (RF) and multiple layer perceptron (MLP) neural network models with three types of features: Magpie, atom vector, and one-hot encoding (atom frequency) for the crystal system and space group prediction of materials. Four types of models for predicting crystal systems and space groups are proposed, trained, and evaluated including one-versus-all binary classifiers, multiclass classifiers, polymorphism predictors, and multilabel classifiers. The synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) is conducted to mitigate the effects of imbalanced data sets. Our results demonstrate that RF with Magpie features generally outperforms other algorithms for binary and multiclass prediction of crystal systems and space groups, while MLP with atom frequency features is the best one for structural polymorphism prediction. For multilabel prediction, MLP with atom frequency and binary relevance with Magpie models are the best for predicting crystal systems and space groups, respectively. Our analysis of the related descriptors identifies a few key contributing features for structural-type prediction such as electronegativity, covalent radius, and Mendeleev number. Our work thus paves a way for fast composition-based structural screening of inorganic materials via predicted material structural properties. \textcopyright{} 2020 American Chemical Society.},

Despite their success, these models have two limitations: (1) their optimal depth is apriori unknown, requiring extensive architecture search or inefficient ensemble of models of varying depths; and (2) their skip connections impose an unnecessarily restrictive fusion scheme, forcing aggregation only at the same-scale feature maps of the encoder and decoder sub-networks. To overcome these two limitations, we propose UNet++, a new neural architecture for semantic and instance segmentation, by (1) alleviating the unknown network depth with an efficient ensemble of U-Nets of varying depths, which partially share an encoder and co-learn simultaneously using deep supervision; (2) redesigning skip connections to aggregate features of varying semantic scales at the decoder sub-networks, leading to a highly flexible feature fusion scheme; and (3) devising a pruning scheme to accelerate the inference speed of UNet++. We have evaluated UNet++ using six different medical image segmentation datasets, covering multiple imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and electron microscopy (EM), and demonstrating that (1) UNet++ consistently outperforms the baseline models for the task of semantic segmentation across different datasets and backbone architectures; (2) UNet++ enhances segmentation quality of varying-size objects-an improvement over the fixed-depth U-Net; (3) Mask RCNN++ (Mask R-CNN with UNet++ design) outperforms the original Mask R-CNN for the task of instance segmentation; and (4) pruned UNet++ models achieve significant speedup while showing only modest performance degradation.
