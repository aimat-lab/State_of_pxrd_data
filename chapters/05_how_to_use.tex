Next to the availability of the opXRD dataset on Zenodo, we further provide an easy-to-use Python library (\url{https://github.com/aimat-lab/xrdpattern}) to download and interface the dataset.
The dataset can be accessed using the simple command 
\pyth{PatternDB.load(data_dirpath)}. Our tool further includes options for standardization, plotting, and the conversion to \emph{PyTorch} tensors.
We provide the following Jupyter notebook that showcases the functionality of the library in more detail: <Link to github Jupyter notebook on Colab>

%The patterns attribute of this class is a list of the indivdual pattern diffractograms, each of which supports a standardize, plot and to tensor method. The standardize method returns a "standardized" version of the pattern with a fixed angle range, a fixed number of entries and intensities normalized to the $[0,1]$ interval.
