% Sources to mention
% Zenodo -> A good amount of raw powder data there but spread into smaller datasets; Inhomogenous, not specially prepared to be worked with by others, therefore difficult to work with especially at scale

% Crystal structures with corresponding simulated diffractograms;
% ->  ICSD 
% - 230k structures;
% - Proprietary

% -> PDF  -> 
%- 1200k "material data sets" (structures?) 
% + 19 k entries with "Experimental raw data digital patterns"; 
%  Proprietary (% PDF pricing: https://www.icdd.com/assets/files/2023-Purchase-Options.pdf)
%The PDF itself lists the following data sources:

% ->  COD (https://www.crystallography.net/cod/)
% -  513k structures,
% - Fully open




\paragraph{Existing datasets} TODO: Summarize the existing datasets shortly, including number of entries, etc.

\begin{itemize}
\item RRUFF
\item Powder Diffraction File (ICDD)

\item Scattered experimental datasets on Zenodo (TODO: roughly estimate size)
\item ...
\end{itemize}
