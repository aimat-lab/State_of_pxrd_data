% Sources to mention
% Zenodo -> A good amount of raw powder data there but spread into smaller datasets; Inhomogenous, not specially prepared to be worked with by others, therefore difficult to work with especially at scale

% Crystal structures with corresponding simulated diffractograms;
% ->  ICSD (https://icsd.products.fiz-karlsruhe.de/) 
% - 230k structures;
% - Proprietary

% -> PDF (https://www.icdd.com/) -> 
%- 1200k "material data sets" (structures?) 
% + 19 k entries with "Experimental raw data digital patterns";

%    \item TODO: Include how many of those are actually experimental pXRD! If we cannot find this information, we need to ask them directly.
