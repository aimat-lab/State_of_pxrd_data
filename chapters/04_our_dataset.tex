% TODOS:
% - This paper talks about the importance of sharing raw powder X-ray diffraction data. I'd definitely cite it ->  \cite{Aranda2018}

%- The subsections of this section should be the 
% individual contributions that we get from labs

In collaboration with several other institutions we have collected a dataset of diffractograms stemming from experiment, some of them labeled with corresponding structural information. \\
Currently, institutions that contributed to our dataset include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Institute of Nanotechnology at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology
    \item University of Southern California
    \item Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
\end{itemize}

We are still in the process of growing the dataset and additional contributions are still very welcome. To find out more about how to contribute to this dataset, visit our website specially designed to collect this dataset, https://xrd.aimat.science \\
