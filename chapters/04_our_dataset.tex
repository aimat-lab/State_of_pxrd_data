In collaboration with several other institutions we have collected a dataset of diffractograms stemming from experiment, some of them labeled with corresponding structural information. \\
Currently, institutions that contributed to our dataset include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Institute of Nanotechnology at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology
    \item University of Southern California
    \item Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory

We extracted experimental pXRD data from the Crystallography Open Database (COD).\cite{Grazulis2009, Vaitkus2023}  The COD is, to our knowledge, the largest open-access collection of experimental crystal structures of organic, inorganic, metal-organic compounds and minerals, containing more than 500,000 entries.\footnote{Available online at \url{https://www.crystallography.net/cod/}} The data in the COD is placed in the public domain and licensed under the CC0 License. Of the entire COD database, 5432 structures (1\% of the database) contained at least one tag from the {CIF\_POW} dictionary, i.e., relating to powder diffraction studies --- which is expected, since most crystal structures are resolved from single crystal diffraction. From these 5432 files, most contained only metadata related to the powder diffraction experiment, but did not include the raw data of the pattern itself. We could extract raw, experimental pXRD patterns from 1063 files in total, after curation of a small number of files with clearly invalid data.

The pXRD data from the COD database are of high quality, with a median resolution of $\Delta(2\theta) = 0.013${\textdegree} and an average number of 9190 points measured per pattern. They span a wide chemical space, including organic, inorganic and hybrid structures, including 75 different elements of the periodic table.

The X-ray diffraction data were collected on a Bruker D8 Advance (Cu Kα1 radiation, λ = 1.54056 Å). The samples were initially recorded for various research projects over the last ten years and were measured with different step sizes, times per step, and over different angle ranges, but all using Cu Kα1 radiation. The samples mostly contained transition metal oxides, sulfides, and fluorides. A major part of the research focused on high-entropy materials, which involved incorporating many different elements into single-phase structures, leading to peak shifts or phase separations. Most of those multicomponent complex materials appeared in various structures, including rock-salt, spinel, fluorite, perovskite, and delafossite, to name a few.The samples were almost always prepared in powder form; therefore, powder XRD was performed on samples with adjusted height. To improve statistics, the samples were rotated during the entire measurement. Some air-sensitive samples were measured using a transparent polymer dome for protection. This dome led to increased background noise over the first 20° and slightly decreased pattern resolution. The samples were prepared using various synthesis techniques, mostly solid-state or wet chemical syntheses, to obtain the desired structures. Consequently, particle size and crystallinity varied significantly. The sample set also includes samples that were not successfully measured or where phases could not be identified. 

We are still in the process of growing the dataset and additional contributions are still very welcome. To find out more about how to contribute to this dataset, visit our website specially designed to collect this dataset, https://xrd.aimat.science .
