abstract = {Abstract Reliable chemical state analysis of Sn semiconductors by XPS is hindered by the marginal observed binding energy shift in the Sn 3d region. For hybrid Sn-based perovskites especially, errors associated with charge referencing can easily exceed chemistry-related shifts. Studies based on the modified Auger parameter α ′ provide a suitable alternative and have been used previously to resolve different chemical states in Sn alloys and oxides. However, the meaningful interpretation of Auger parameter variations on Sn-based perovskite semiconductors requires fundamental studies. In this work, a comprehensive Auger parameter study is performed through systematic compositional variations of Sn halide perovskites. It is found that in addition to the oxidation state, α ′ is highly sensitive to the composition of the halide site, inducing shifts of up to Δα ′ = 2 eV between ASnI3 and ASnBr3 type perovskites. The reported dependencies of α ′ on the Sn oxidation state, coordination and local chemistry provide a framework that enables reliable tracking of degradation as well as X-site composition for Sn-based perovskites and related compounds. The higher robustness and sensitivity of such studies not only enables more in-depth surface analysis of Sn-based perovskites than previously performed, but also increases reproducibility across laboratories.},

abstract  ="To optimize material stability{,} automated high-throughput workflows are of increasing interest. However{,} many of those workflows either employ synthesis techniques not suitable for large-area depositions or are carried out in ambient conditions{,} which limits the transferability of the results. While combinatorial approaches based on vapour-based depositions are inherently scalable{,} their potential for controlled stability assessments has yet to be exploited. Based on MAPbI3 thin films as a prototypical system{,} we demonstrate a combinatorial inert-gas workflow to study intrinsic materials degradation{,} closely resembling conditions in encapsulated devices. Specifically{,} we probe the stability of MAPbI3 thin films with varying residual PbI2 content. A comprehensive set of automated characterization techniques is used to investigate the structure and phase constitution of pristine and aged thin films. A custom-designed in situ UV-Vis aging setup is used for real-time photospectroscopy measurements of the material libraries under relevant aging conditions{,} such as heat or light-bias exposure. These measurements are used to gain insights into the degradation kinetics{,} which can be linked to intrinsic degradation processes such as autocatalytic decomposition. Despite scattering effects{,} which complicate the conventional interpretation of in situ UV-Vis results{,} we demonstrate how a machine learning model trained on the comprehensive characterization data before and after the aging process can link changes in the optical spectra to phase changes during aging. Consequently{,} this approach does not only enable semi-quantitative comparisons of material stability but also provides detailed insights into the underlying degradation processes which are otherwise mostly reported for investigations on single samples."}

year = {2015},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Top-performing deep architectures are trained on massive amounts of labeled data. In the absence of labeled data for a certain task, domain adaptation often provides an attractive option given that labeled data of similar nature but from a different domain (e.g. synthetic images) are available. Here, we propose a new approach to domain adaptation in deep architectures that can be trained on large amount of labeled data from the source domain and large amount of unlabeled data from the target domain (no labeled target-domain data is necessary).As the training progresses, the approach promotes the emergence of "deep" features that are (i) discriminative for the main learning task on the source domain and (ii) invariant with respect to the shift between the domains. We show that this adaptation behaviour can be achieved in almost any feed-forward model by augmenting it with few standard layers and a simple new gradient reversal layer. The resulting augmented architecture can be trained using standard back propagation.Overall, the approach can be implemented with little effort using any of the deep-learning packages. The method performs very well in a series of image classification experiments, achieving adaptation effect in the presence of big domain shifts and outperforming previous state-of-the-art on Office datasets.},
